## Problem Statement

In Sonora, substantial public data is available on births; however, adolescent births have received limited public attention. This dashboard aims not only to update but also to enrich the existing information on the open data portal by creating an accessible tool for civil society. The dashboard allows users to explore key metrics, such as adolescent fertility rates, annual birth counts by municipality, maternal health overviews, education levels, and more. With this tool, users can easily interact with the data and draw individual conclusions based on their specific areas of interest.
